# What is Warlock?

**Warlock** is an MIT App Inventor Extension Builder that builds extensions. It doesn't need to be installed unlike Appinventor-Sources & It does not need Apache Ant at all!, The installation of Warlock offline is Optional, but I would reccomend building extensions using Warlock online.

# Some tools made for Warlock in this list, are not natively supported. You need to download the JAR files or access the tool via browsers (if the tool is a website).
## Supports

Java 8 for creating extensions (dx)

Java 11 for creating extensions (d8)

Progaurd for protecting from decompiling, for optimizing/shrinking, obfuscating & preverifing.
